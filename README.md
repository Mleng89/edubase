# EduBase (WIP)

Creating a platform where educators just have one stop for everything they need.


### Currently:

The web platform at the moment can only allow for users to sign up and sign in. Signing in will also show routes explicitly for logged in users.

### Next features:

Users that are logged in will have the ability to upload lesson plans to share amongst everybody else on the EduBase platform.

Uploading lesson plans will also allow other users to submit comments, this can be in the form of feedback, or gratitude for the inspiration.

## Getting started:

If you wish to run this on your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Mleng89/edubase.git
cd edubase
code .
npm install
npm run start
```

## Script
`npm run start` will start a development server on your local machine for the project.
